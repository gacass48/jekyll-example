## Disc Golf

Unsurprisingly, Disc Golf is the most popular pursuit of Heimburglandia residents. Due to its conveinent location next to the Steady Ed Headrick course, many residents frequent the course.

## Grilling

Heimburglandia residents often grill using their Rec Tec Grills, the sponsor of the 2019 National Tour Finale. The grilling is a great community activity that brings the town together and refuel after a great round of disc golf.
