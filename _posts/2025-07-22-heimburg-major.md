Huzzah Huzzah! He's finally done it! Calvin Heimburg has claimed victory at the 2025 European Disc Golf Festival and won his first major title. Tearing up the course all week in Estonia's first major tournament, Heimburg ended up 49 under par after 4 rounds, and nailed a 40 foot putt on the last hole to win. His incredible play and clutch moments down the strech proved his prowess in the sport and leaves the residents of Heimburglandia rejoycing all over town.
