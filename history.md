Heimburglandia began in the late 2010s as our idol Calvin began to climb the ranks of the Professional Disc Golf Association(PDGA). Calvin began playing tournaments in 2010 and started collecting noteriety in 2016 with a 14th place finish at the World Championships. Drawn in by his dry wit and exciting throws, fans from all over the globe began to gather to appreciate Heimburg's pizza style putt and long drives. Located at the Ed Headrick Memorial disc golf course, Heimburglandia began after Calvin defeated Adam Hammes to win the National Tour Finale in 2019. Ever since then, Calvin has been drawing in more and more fans with his exciting throws, winning tornaments, and was finally able to capture his first major tournament in 2025. Heimburglandia has also developed since 2019, with new running water, a zipline, and ferry system as new additions in 2025.
