## Alligator

Another signature cusine of Heimburglandia, based on Calvin's Floridian origins, Alligator is available at several locations across the settlement.

## Tacos

Another classic frisbee term inspires cuisine in Heimburglandia. The tacos in Heimburglandia are piled high with delectable moresels, while the shells look like a disc folded in half after raging over a missed putt.
